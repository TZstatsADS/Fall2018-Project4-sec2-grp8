# Introduction {-}

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of converting scanned images of machine printed or
handwritten text (numerals, letters, and symbols), into machine readable character streams, plain (e.g. text files) or formatted (e.g. HTML files). As shown in Figure 1, the data *workflow* in a typical OCR system consists of three major stages:

* Pre-processing

* OCR character recognition

* Post-processing

![](../figs/ocr_flowchart.png) 

We have processed raw scanned images through the first two steps are relying on the [Tessearct OCR machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)). R package tutorial can be found [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-new-tesseract-package-high-quality-ocr-in-r/). 

BUT this is not the FOCUS of this project!!!

In this project, we are going to **focus on the third stage -- post-processing**, which includes two tasks: *error detection* and *error correction*.  

# Step 1 - Load library and source code
```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
if (!require("pacman")) {
  ## devtools is required
  library(devtools)
  install_github("trinker/pacman")
}

library(caret)

pacman::p_load(knitr, readr, stringr, tesseract, vecsets)
source('../lib/ifCleanToken.R')
file_name_vec <- list.files("../data/ground_truth") #100 files in total
```

# Step 2 - read the files and conduct Tesseract OCR

Although we have processed the Tesseract OCR and save the output txt files in the `data` folder, we include this chunk of code in order to make clear the whole pipeline to you.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# for(i in c(1:length(file_name_vec))){
#   current_file_name <- sub(".txt","",file_name_vec[i])
#   ## png folder is not provided on github (the code is only on demonstration purpose)
#   current_tesseract_txt <- tesseract::ocr(paste("../data/png/",current_file_name,".png",sep=""))
#   
#   ### clean the tessetact text (separate line by "\n", delete null string, transter to lower case)
#   clean_tesseract_txt <- strsplit(current_tesseract_txt,"\n")[[1]]
#   clean_tesseract_txt <- clean_tesseract_txt[clean_tesseract_txt!=""]
#   
#   ### save tesseract text file
#   writeLines(clean_tesseract_txt, paste("../data/tesseract/",current_file_name,".txt",sep=""))
# }
```

# Step 3 - Error detection

Now, we are ready to conduct post-processing, based on the Tessearct OCR output. First of all, we need to detect errors, or *incorrectly processed words* -- check to see if an input string is a valid dictionary word or if its n-grams are all legal.

The referenced papers are:

1. [Rule-based techniques](http://webpages.ursinus.edu/akontostathis/KulpKontostathisFinal.pdf)

- rules are in the section 2.2 

2. [Letter n-gram](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1672564)

- focus on positional binary digram in section 3-a.error detection

3. Probabilistic techniques -- [SVM garbage detection](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2034617.2034626)

- features are in section 5 (you can choose not to implement ‘Levenshtein distance’ feature)


In this statercode, we implement the first three rules in the first paper -- rule based techniques, as an example.

## Data preparation

```{r}
# read ground truth text into 1 list
n_file = length(file_name_vec)
tesseract_vec_all = list() # each element is a vector of words for each text file
tesseract_lines_all = list() # each element is a list of lines for each text file
gt_vec_all = list() # each element is a vector of words for each text file
gt_lines_all = list() # each element is a list of lines for each text file
len_check = rep(NA, 100)
len_check2 = rep(NA, 100)

## check if each tesseract file has the same number of length with its corresponding ground truth

for(i in 1:n_file){
  ## i represents that this is the i-th file we are dealing with
  current_file_name <- sub(".txt","",file_name_vec[i])
  
  ## read the ground truth text, save it by lines & vectorize it
  current_ground_truth_txt = readLines(paste("../data/ground_truth/",current_file_name,".txt",sep=""), warn=FALSE)
  
  ## read the tesseract text, save it by lines & vectorize it
  current_tesseract_txt <- readLines(paste("../data/tesseract/",current_file_name,".txt",sep=""), warn=FALSE)
  
  ## check if each tesseract file has the same number of length with its corresponding ground truth
  len_check[i] = length(current_ground_truth_txt) == length(current_tesseract_txt)
  ## check if all ground truth are not shorter than its Tesseract
  len_check2[i] = length(current_ground_truth_txt) >= length(current_tesseract_txt)
}

# there exist pairs that do not have same number of lines:
which(!len_check) 
# all ground truth files have at least same number of lines compared with corresponding Tesseract files:
which(!len_check2) 
n_file-sum(len_check)
```

The above chunck shows that 13 pairs of Tesseract and ground truth files do not have the same number of lines, and for such pairs, the ground truth files always have more lines than the Tesseract files.

Therefore, we trimmed the ground truth files manually until they have the same length with the corresponding Tesseract files, and saved them in a new folder called "ground_truth_trimmed". 

To simplify the word alignment process, we only work on the line pairs that have same number of words.

All the process stated below are based on trimmed files, same length line pairs.

```{r}
same_na = rep(NA, n_file)

## count number of lines in total
raw_lines = 0
processed_lines = 0

for(i in 1:n_file){
  ## i represents that this is the i-th file we are dealing with
  current_file_name <- sub(".txt","",file_name_vec[i])
  
  ## read the ground truth text
  current_ground_truth_txt = readLines(paste("../data/ground_truth_trimmed/",current_file_name,".txt",sep=""), warn=FALSE)
  
  ## read the tesseract text
  current_tesseract_txt <- readLines(paste("../data/tesseract/",current_file_name,".txt",sep=""), warn=FALSE)

  ## only keep the line pairs that have the same number of words
  n_line = length(current_ground_truth_txt)
  raw_lines = n_line + raw_lines
  
  for (j in 1:n_line){
    same_len_logi = length(str_split(current_ground_truth_txt[j], " ")[[1]]) == 
      length(str_split(current_tesseract_txt[j], " ")[[1]])
    if(!same_len_logi){
      current_ground_truth_txt[j] = NA
      current_tesseract_txt[j] = NA
    }
  }
  na_logi1 = is.na(current_ground_truth_txt)
  na_logi2 = is.na(current_tesseract_txt)
  same_na[i] = all(na_logi1 == na_logi2) # check if all the lines are assigned accordingly
  
  ## save and vectorized cleaned text
  gt_lines_all[[i]] = current_ground_truth_txt[!na_logi1]
  gt_vec_all[[i]] <- str_split(paste(gt_lines_all[[i]], collapse = " ")," ")[[1]]
  tesseract_lines_all[[i]] = current_tesseract_txt[!na_logi2]
  tesseract_vec_all[[i]] = str_split(paste(tesseract_lines_all[[i]], collapse = " ")," ")[[1]]
  
  processed_lines = length(gt_lines_all[[i]]) + processed_lines
  
  ## re-check if each tesseract file has the same number of length with its corresponding ground truth
  len_check[i] = length(tesseract_lines_all[[i]]) == length(gt_lines_all[[i]])
}
## recheck if lines are removed correctly
all(same_na)
## re-check if each tesseract file has the same number of length with its corresponding ground truth
all(len_check)

## recheck if all the words in a pair of files can be mapped 1 to 1 now
map11 = rep(NA,n_file)
for(i in 1:n_file){
  map11[i] = length(tesseract_vec_all[[i]]) == length(gt_vec_all[[i]])
}
all(map11)

## What is the proportion of lines deleted because of unequal number of words
1 - processed_lines/raw_lines # = 0.1132
```

## Detection

Each element in the list in this following chunck is a dataframe for a pair of files. Each row in a dataframe contains the Tesseract word, its ground truth word and the detect output.

```{r}
MatchDetect = list()
MatchDetectCharacter = list()
for(i in 1:n_file){
  tesseract_vec <- tesseract_vec_all[[i]]
  tesseract_if_clean <- unlist(lapply(tesseract_vec,ifCleanToken)) # source code of ifCleanToken in in lib folder
  mat = cbind(tesseract_vec_all[[i]], gt_vec_all[[i]],tesseract_if_clean)
  save(mat, file=paste0("../output/mats/mat_file",i,".RData"))
  df = data.frame(mat)
  df2 = data.frame(mat, stringsAsFactors = F)
  colnames(df) = c("Tesseract", "GroundTruth", "Detect")
  colnames(df2) = c("Tesseract", "GroundTruth", "Detect")
  MatchDetect[[i]] = df # character vectors are converted to factors
  MatchDetectCharacter[[i]] = df2 # character vectors are not converted to factors
}
save(MatchDetect, file="../output/MatchDetect.RData")
save(MatchDetectCharacter, file="../output/MatchDetectCharacter.RData")

# dFunc = function(i){
#   ## detect tesseract word error
#   tesseract_vec <- tesseract_vec_all[[i]]
#   tesseract_if_clean <- unlist(lapply(tesseract_vec,ifCleanToken)) # source code of ifCleanToken in in lib folder
#   
#   return(tesseract_if_clean)
# }
# 
# DetectOutput = lapply(1:length(file_name_vec), dFunc)
```

# Step 4 - Error correction

Given the detected word error, in order to find the best correction, we need to generating the candidate corrections: a dictionary or a database of legal n-grams to locate one or more potential correction terms. Then we need invoke some lexical-similarity measure between the misspelled string and the candidates or a probabilistic estimate of the likelihood of the correction to rank order the candidates.

## Match Tesseract to ground truth

The **len_check** variable shows whether a ground truth file and a Tesseract file have the same length. For the 13 pairs that do not have the same number of lines, we manually adjust the Tesseract files until they have the same length.

```{r}







```

# Step 5 - Performance measure

The two most common OCR accuracy measures are precision and recall. Both are relative measures of the OCR accuracy because they are computed as ratios of the correct output to the total output (precision) or input (recall). More formally defined,
\begin{align*}
\mbox{precision}&=\frac{\mbox{number of correct items}}{\mbox{number of items in OCR output}}\\
\mbox{recall}&=\frac{\mbox{number of correct items}}{\mbox{number of items in ground truth}}
\end{align*}
where *items* refer to either characters or words, and ground truth is the original text stored in the plain text file. 

Both *precision* and *recall* are mathematically convenient measures because their numeric values are some decimal fractions in the range between 0.0 and 1.0, and thus can be written as percentages. For instance, recall is the percentage of words in the original text correctly found by the OCR engine, whereas precision is the percentage of correctly found words with respect to the total word count of the OCR output. Note that in the OCR-related literature, the term OCR accuracy often refers to recall.

Here, we only finished the **word level evaluation** criterions, you are required to complete the **letter-level** part.

```{r detection word level}
precisionDE<-rep(0,100)
precisionBM<-rep(0,100)

recallDE<-rep(0,100)
recallBM<-rep(0,100)

intersect_vec<-list()

for (i in 1:100) {
  
  precisionDE[i]<-sum(unlist(DetectOutput[i]))/length(unlist(tesseract_vec_all[i]))
  
  recallDE[i]<-sum(unlist(DetectOutput[i]))/length(unlist(gt_vec_all[i]))
  
  intersect_vec[i]<- length(vecsets::vintersect(tolower(unlist(gt_vec_all[i])),tolower(unlist(tesseract_vec_all[i]))))
  
  precisionBM[i]<-as.numeric(intersect_vec[i])/length(unlist(tesseract_vec_all[i]))
  
  recallBM[i]<-as.numeric(intersect_vec[i])/length(unlist(gt_vec_all[i]))
}
```

```{r detection confusion matrix}
load("../output/MatchDetectCharacter.RData")
CompareMD = MatchDetectCharacter
compareFunc = function(df){
  df$Actual = df$Tesseract == df$GroundTruth
  return(df)
}

CompareDetect = lapply(CompareMD, compareFunc) # each element is a dataframe with a new column of actual detection
## merge the detect and actual comparison of all 100 files into 1 matric
CompareTF = cbind(unlist(sapply(CompareDetect, `[[`, "Detect")), unlist(sapply(CompareDetect, `[[`, "Actual"))) %>%
  data.frame()
colnames(CompareTF) = c("Detect", "Actual")

## confusion matrix calculation
confusionMatrix(data = CompareTF$Detect, reference = CompareTF$Actual)
```


```{r}
ground_truth_vec <- str_split(paste(current_ground_truth_txt, collapse = " ")," ")[[1]] #1078
old_intersect_vec <- vecsets::vintersect(tolower(ground_truth_vec), tolower(tesseract_vec)) #607
new_intersect_vec <- vecsets::vintersect(tolower(ground_truth_vec), tolower(tesseract_delete_error_vec)) #600

OCR_performance_table <- data.frame("Tesseract" = rep(NA,4),
                                    "Tesseract_with_postprocessing" = rep(NA,4))
row.names(OCR_performance_table) <- c("word_wise_recall","word_wise_precision",
                                                 "character_wise_recall","character_wise_precision")
OCR_performance_table["word_wise_recall","Tesseract"] <- length(old_intersect_vec)/length(ground_truth_vec)
OCR_performance_table["word_wise_precision","Tesseract"] <- length(old_intersect_vec)/length(tesseract_vec)
OCR_performance_table["word_wise_recall","Tesseract_with_postprocessing"] <- length(new_intersect_vec)/length(ground_truth_vec)
OCR_performance_table["word_wise_precision","Tesseract_with_postprocessing"] <- length(new_intersect_vec)/length(tesseract_delete_error_vec)
kable(OCR_performance_table, caption="Summary of OCR performance")
```
